Since then I’ve been involved in many different roles throughout my career.\n\nI’ve indulged myself in writing Flutter code since 2020, and have been very pleased with what it enables me. This website is my take on writing Flutter on the web.\n\nI’m a passionate Flutter dev, learning every time whilst trying to teach others what I’ve learned so far. I was surprised by Youtube videos, where I explain what I am doing. The feedback from students of Flutter is amazing at the same time heartwarming.\n\nSo, far I’ve learned a little bit about Flutter and made a few mobile and web apps. I have learned about video editing, writing scripts, and thumbnails.\n\nAnd last but not the least, I've happily used Firebase as the backend for all my projects.",
