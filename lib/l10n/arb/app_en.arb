    "aboutMeDetail": "Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! \n \n Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients. \n \n I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React. \n \n Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:",
